# ZoomControl
ZoomControlMenuAppForMacOS<br>
This is the full app if you want a build version https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j8tArEalx0wLlxuxIT1lA9ZMj68_9RC_/view?usp=sharing<br>
I don't have Apple Developer account at the moment.<br><br>
This app only works with US keyboard key lineup and uses virtual keys. For it to work properly if it doesn't worked when you launched, try this aproach, go to system settings > accesibility > zoom and check 'Use keyboard shortcuts to zoom' this should work.<br><br>
If macOS doesn't give you an access to open the app it is because i don't have an Apple Developer account at the moment, try system settings > Privacy & Security and Scroll down to the "Security" section look for a message about ZoomControl being blocked if it is click 'Open Anyway'.<br><br>
This is very basic solution that i had fixed for myself. I am a Windows user that bought a mac mini m4 base specs for coding and had a hard time while using it :) many basic stuff doesn't exist.
